## Institutional contacts: the framework, and residency (#276,
## `docs/mechanics/institutional-contacts.md` §1, §2).
##
## 🔒 **There is no institutional-contact machinery, and there must not be.**
## Every question one of them raises is answered somewhere `contacts.md` already
## has: what his loyalty does, how he gets it, what he asks for, what his bias
## is. **A change made for one of them must not silently move the others**, which
## is what building him out of the base contact guarantees.
##
## 🔒 **An extension never creates a second contact.** The cathedral widens the
## clergyman the church brought.
##
## 🔒 **And he is lost with his building or his town, with no successor.** The
## church rebuilt brings a new man who remembers nothing.
